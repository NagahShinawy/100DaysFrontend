    #1 - How the web works ?
    
    # Request [ client frontend ] Response [ server backend ] cycle
    # 1- Browsing the web is like calling a friend.
    # 2- you type URL : uniform resource locator ==> www.amazom.com
    # 3- I want to see website (request)
    # 4- HTTP (method of communcation between client and the server)
    # 5- HTTP the language that client [ Browse ] and server [remote computer] speak
    # 6- The remote computer [server] return back with response to the client [ Browser ]
    # 7- The response is the instructions that the Browse understad
    # 8- web developers write these instructions

    2- Which code do we developers write ?
    # What are these "Browser instructions" ?

    1- instructions [codes] that tell the Browser what should be displayed on the screen.
    2 - HTML : Hyper text markup language
            - defined the content and structure of the displayed pages.
            - build structure and content of web pages.
            - inputs , forms, text, images
    
    3- CSS: Cascading style sheets
            - define style for web pages

    4- JavaScript : adding interactivity to web pages

    3- How the web works in deep ?

    1- URL uniform Resource Locator [ https:amazom.com/mobiles ]
    2- https: Hypertext transfer protocol (secure)
    3- domain: amazon.com
            - Human readable address ("identifier of the website")
    4- mobiles: [path] is a pointer on a give website to a specific resource
    5- Domain maps to IP [ internet protocol ] a unique identifier address of the network devices
    6- not easy to memorize ip address for humans so you can access websites using IPs
    7- every comupter on the int has IP.
    8- every device has IP address but not every device has adomain
    9- DNS: Domain Name System: domain IP mapping , stores domain <--> IP translation tables, stores doamin ip lookup tables.
    10- Browser talk with DNS server to translate doamin to IP address, 
        then Browser send request to machine that server website.
    11- this is super quick and takes only mseconds.
